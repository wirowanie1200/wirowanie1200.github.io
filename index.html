            <h3>Online Disorder Detection</h3>
            <p>One of my most significant projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP) was Online Disorder Detection, where I developed a model aimed at identifying signs of mental health disorders in online text. This project combined my expertise in linguistics and computational methods to analyze textual patterns indicative of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder.</p>
            <img src="image.jpg" alt="Online Disorder Detection project image">
            <p><strong>The project involved:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection & Preprocessing:</strong> I gathered and cleaned large datasets from online forums and social media, ensuring ethical considerations and anonymization.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Analysis & Feature Engineering:</strong> Using sentiment analysis, lexical patterns, and psychological markers, I extracted key linguistic features that correlate with mental health conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning & NLP Techniques:</strong> I applied transformer-based models (such as BERT) and traditional NLP methods to classify texts based on potential mental health risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation & Results:</strong> The model was tested for accuracy, precision, and recall, showing promising results in identifying early warning signs of mental distress in user-generated content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project deepened my understanding of applied NLP in the healthcare domain and fueled my interest in technology's potential to improve mental health care.</p>

                <h1>Health & Well-being</h1>
        <p>Managing <strong>health conditions</strong> has been a significant part of my journey. I have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</strong> (currently in remission)</li>
            <li><strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Depression</strong></li>
            <li>Currently undergoing <strong>the diagnostic process for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This journey has been both <strong>eye-opening and challenging</strong>, but I remain <strong>resilient and proactive</strong> in understanding myself better. 
           Through therapy, self-reflection, and professional guidance, I strive to <strong>grow and adapt</strong>, even when life presents difficulties.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Adam, and I‚Äôm a 24-year-old student pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in English Philology with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I‚Äôm passionate about language and technology, and I love exploring how computational methods can enhance linguistic understanding. Alongside my studies, I work at TJX, balancing my academic and professional responsibilities with dedication.</p>
        <p>Beyond my studies and work, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and motivated. I enjoy baking, genealogy, and speed walking. Tracing family history gives me a sense of connection to the past, while baking allows me to experiment and create something delicious. Speed walking is my way of challenging myself physically and clearing my mind. These interests reflect my analytical mindset, appreciation for tradition, and drive for self-improvement.</p>
        <p>Health and well-being play a big role in my life. I manage hypothyroidism and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (currently in remission), along with mental health challenges like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and depression. Recently, I‚Äôve started the diagnostic process for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which has been both eye-opening and difficult. Despite the struggles, I keep pushing forward, working with professionals to better understand myself and find ways to grow.</p>
        <p>Life isn‚Äôt always easy, but I remain introspective, curious, and resilient. Whether it‚Äôs through my academic ambitions, personal exploration, or creative interests, I‚Äôm always striving for self-improvement and deeper understanding.</p>
